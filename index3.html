When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought
me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. 
Each hasgiven me a unique learning experience.
<br>
<br>
<br>
At five, I <a href="https://starz.com"> marveled </a> at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights.
 When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek
  gondolas.<img src=Image2.jpg.jpeg alt="picture" style="float:left; padding: 20px;height: 200px;width:200px;">
At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the
thousand-year-old stones were still in place just as it is in <a href="www.starzcollege.com">Starz University</a>
it was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.
<br>
<br>
<br> 
It began with French,which taught me the importance of pronunciation.
 I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where this Pyramides was.
But when I pronounced it pyramides instead of pyramides,with more accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.
In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its similarities with English through cognates.
 Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>



This was incredible to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates come to the
rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.

 As I studied Chinese at myschool, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character,
the meaning is lost. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
I loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and
Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. 
I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.
